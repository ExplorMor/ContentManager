Brachiopods are a type of marine animal with two external shells. Although superficially similar to the clams (bivalves), the two groups of animals actually have very different internal anatomy and shell composition. 
During the Ordovician radiation, the level of biodiversity increased  as brachiopods became dominant during  the Paleozoic Era.  During this period brachiopods filled ecological niches as filter feeders, reef builders, epibionts, and others. Brachiopods exist today in greatly reduced numbers and are typically found in very cold or very deep water.
