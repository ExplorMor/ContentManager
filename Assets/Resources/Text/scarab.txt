Little is known about the habits of <i>Bolbocerastes regalis</i>, other than it digs vertical burrows in sandy desert areas in southwestern North America and is mostly active in the late winter and spring.  The burrows can be distinguished from most other insect burrows by the characteristically "ropy" push-up mounds, which look like a small pile of broken cylinders made by pushing wet sand through a dime-sized opening.  Burrows containing beetles are usually plugged near their entrance, while empty burrows often have an open center hole.
