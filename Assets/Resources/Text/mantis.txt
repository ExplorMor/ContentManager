The Carolina mantis, like all other praying mantis species, is a predator that feeds primarily on other Arthropods or insectivore. Members of the group, including both ambush and pursuit predators, occupy diverse habitats distributed across the globe, although their greatest numbers and diversity are concentrated primarily in the tropics.
Though unfortunate for their prey, the voracious appetite of the Carolina mantis has shown some usefulness for humans, as mantises are sometimes employed as agents of biological control in gardens.
