An important feature of Daisy Earthstars is their ability to be hygroscopic, in that they respond to changing humidity conditions by closing and expanding the rays that surround the spore sac. Daisy Earthstars also have held various medicinal purposes. Native Americans used the powdery mature inner mass of puffballs to stop bleeding. The billions of dry spores inside a puffball are relatively aseptic and were ideal for dressing wounds.
Mushrooms and related fungi (macrofungi) play a critical role in the lives of plants and animals, including humans, yet their diversity is underestimated. Understanding this diversity will be critical in analyzing impacts of habitat change, distributions, and diversity of host organisms. Over the past 150 years, 1.4 million dried scientific specimens have been conserved in 35 institutions in 24 states, with digitization efforts underway to make these collections and their data accessible online.
