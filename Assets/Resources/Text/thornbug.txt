The <i>Membracidae</i> family belongs to the insect order Hemiptera (true bugs, leafhoppers, planthoppers, cicadas, aphids, whiteflies) and includes over 3,300 species of herbivorous insects commonly known as treehoppers. Similar to cicadas, treehoppers communicate with specific songs to attract mates, announce the discovery of a new prime feeding spot, or to alert each other to the presence of a predator. Treehopper songs are not audible to the human ear because they consist of vibrations transmitted through the stems of the host plant instead of the air. This process is called substrate vibration, and requires special recording equipment to translate into an audible song.
