Hummingbirds, like many bird species, communicate through a variety of actions, including visual display, physical interaction, chirping, and chattering. However, they have a rather unique method of communication. Male ruby-throated hummingbirds have iridescent feathers, which are used to attract females and deter other males. These iridescent colors are caused by both pigments and microscopic ridges, which create a grid that reflects different light patterns depending on the distance from the display. This is important in attracting mates, as hummingbirds have excellent color vision and can even see ultraviolet light. Male ruby-throated hummingbirds display their colors and agility to females in daring courtship displays. This display involves diving from heights of up to 50 feet and flying side-to-side in front of the female.
