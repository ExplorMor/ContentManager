Many stink bug species play important roles in their native environments, such as consuming pests. However, the brown marmorated stink bug (<i>Halymorpha halys</i>) is itself a major agricultural pest, attacking fields of fruits and vegetables and causing major economic damage. The brown marmorated stink bug was brought to the United States from Asia and is now considered an invasive species. As a "true bug," it uses its proboscis to suck juices from its host plant. The stink bug gets its name from stink glands located on the underside of its thorax. The strong scent is used to deter predators like birds and lizards.
