Elk kelp, named for its antler-like appearance, grows in subtidal forests off the coasts of southern California and northwestern Baja Peninsula. It is the second largest algae after the aptly named giant kelp. Elk kelp is anchored by a holdfast (similar in structure to roots) in sediment. At the opposite end, a buoyant oval pneumatocyst lifts the stipe (similar to a stem) up into the water. A strong storm can be enough to break the kelp at its stipe, so broken pieces of elk kelp can often be seen washed up on shore.
