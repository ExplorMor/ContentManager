Tsetse flies belong to the genus <i>Glossina</i>, of which there are about 25 currently recognized species. They are one of only a few groups of flies that give birth to live young. Adult tsetse flies are parasites that feed only on blood, which makes them potent disease vectors to mammals (e.g., humans and cattle) for a protozoan called <i>Trypanosoma</i>.  <i>Trypanosoma</i> parasitizes mammals and can cause several different kinds of dangerous diseases, including sleeping sickness.
