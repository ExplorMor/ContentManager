The zebra mussel is a small freshwater bivalve about the size of a fingernail and is named for the zigzag lines on the shell. It was originally found in the Caspian Sea and rivers that flow from the Ural Mountains in Russia, but has been accidentally transported on ships to many parts of the world where they are now considered an invasive species.

Zebra mussels attach themselves by byssus threads to lake and river bottom surfaces such as silt, rocks, and shells. They are filter feeders, filtering food and other particles from the water and excreting waste and non-edible matter.
