Originally residents of the southern United States, channel catfish have become abundant and widespread throughout North American waters. Channel catfish show high tolerance for a wide variety of habitats and can survive in streams, lakes, reservoirs, and even brackish water near the Gulf Coast. These fish are easily recognized by their long, whisker-like barbels for which the species gets its name. 		
Because visibility is low in deep and turbid waters, catfish often use taste buds located on their barbels and other body surfaces to locate food.
